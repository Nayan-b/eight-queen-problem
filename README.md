The n-queen puzzle has been implemented using React JS and the backtracking algorithm. The implementation allows users to play the puzzle themselves or ask for assistance to receive guidance on the next move.

The backtracking algorithm involves iteratively trying different solutions until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted. In the context of the n-queen puzzle, the algorithm places queens on the board and checks if they are in a valid position. If a queen is placed in an invalid position, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different position until a valid solution is found.

The React JS implementation utilizes state and props to manage the state of the puzzle board and user interactions. Users can interact with the board by clicking on squares to place or remove queens. When assistance is requested, the implementation uses the backtracking algorithm to calculate the next valid move and highlights it on the board for the user.

To run the implementation, users should have Node.js and npm installed. They can then navigate to the project directory and run the command "npm start" to launch the application in a web browser.
